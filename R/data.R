#' @description Genus gives the abundance of 27 common tree genera in the tropical moist forest
#' of the Congo-Basin and 40 geo-referenced environmental variables on one thousand 8 by 8 km plots
#'  (observations). Each plot's data was obtained by aggregating the data measured on a variable
#'  number of previously sampled 0.5 ha sub-plots. Geo-referenced environmental variables were
#'  used to describe the physical factors as well as vegetation characteristics.
#'  14 physical factors were used pertaining the description of topography, geology and rainfall
#'  of each plot. Vegetation is characterized through 16-days enhanced vegetation index (EVI) data.
